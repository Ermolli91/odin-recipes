Foundations - Project: Recipes

This project consists in creating a simple website with only HTML, which has a series of recipes. It is made after following The Odin Project's Foundations course, currently in the HTML Foundations.

Initially, it will only have what I have learned until now: head, body, emphasized text, lists, images, links. It is expected to be improved as I continue learning through the course.
